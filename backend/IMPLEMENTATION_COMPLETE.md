# ✅ Phase 2 & 3 Implementation Complete

## What Was Implemented

### Phase 2: Skills Data Collection ✅

1. **Backend Updated** (`main.py`)
   - Added `skills` parameter to `/student/save-profile` endpoint
   - Students can now submit skills as comma-separated text
   - Skills stored in `student_profiles.skills` column

2. **Database Migration** ✅ Applied
   - Skills column added to student_profiles
   - Performance indexes created
   - Migration: `add_skills_migration.py`

3. **Score Calculation Enhanced**
   - Skills matching logic implemented (line ~1070 in main.py)
   - Compares student skills with job requirements
   - Awards 0-25 points based on match percentage
   - Falls back to partial credit if data unavailable

### Phase 3: Company Job Integration ✅

1. **Database Enhanced** ✅ Applied
   - `opportunities` table updated with:
     - `company_job_id` (links to company_job_postings)
     - `skills` (job requirements)
     - `description` (job details)
     - `vacancies` (positions available)
     - `min_score` (minimum eligibility)
   - Foreign key constraint added
   - Migration: `migrations/add_company_job_integration.py`

2. **Sync Endpoint Created**
   - `POST /admin/sync-job-postings-to-opportunities`
   - Syncs company portal jobs to allocation system
   - Creates/updates opportunities automatically

3. **Full Integration Complete**
   - Company posts job with skills → stored in company_job_postings
   - Admin syncs → opportunities table updated
   - Students matched → full 25-point skills scoring active
   - Allocation runs → best matches found

## How to Use

### For Admins:
```bash
# Before running allocation, sync job postings:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/admin/sync-job-postings-to-opportunities

# Then run allocation:
python run_allocation.py
```

### For Students:
When creating profile, include skills:
```
skills: "Python, Java, SQL, Machine Learning"
```

### For Companies:
Post jobs with skills requirements in the company portal (already working).

## Files Modified

1. `main.py` - Skills parameter added, score calculation enhanced, sync endpoint added
2. `student_profiles` table - Skills column added
3. `opportunities` table - 5 new columns added
4. Migrations created and applied successfully
